# Macro Runner
 A gpc script made to run custom macros. This is a script used to run macros to complete repetitive tasks. You can create your own macro.gmk file and this script will run it. An sd card will be needed to store your gmk file. To activate the macro, switch to the profile containing this script. A custom gmk file can be made by using gtuner. There are now two versions of this script. The "light_k.gph" file is required for this program to change the light colors on the TitanTwo.

**Version 1.0.5 (For older controllers)**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Press R3 twice quickly to activate your macro. Repeat to deactivate.

**Version 2.0.0 (For newer controllers)**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Press the share button once to activate the macro. Press it quickly twice to switch between macro files. I have rewritten the code to make it easier to change macro file names or add more macro files by editing the code. Currently the TitanTwo can show the status of the script as follows:  

Blue = Deactivated  
Red = Activated, macro.gmk file  
White = Activated, macro2.gmk file
